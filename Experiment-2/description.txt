In this experiment, we created a minimal, clean web interface for a simple bank account balance display with interactive buttons for "Deposit" and "Withdraw." The project combines HTML and CSS to build a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

1. HTML Structure
The webpage is structured using semantic and straightforward HTML elements.

We included a container <div> with the class outer_box to serve as the outer wrapper, which provides padding, rounded corners, and shadow effects to give depth.

Inside it, there is another <div> with the class inner_box, which further organizes the content and contains:

An <h1> element that initially displays the account balance as $0.

Two buttons inside separate <div> elements:

A green "Deposit" button with the class deposit.

A red "Withdraw" button with the class withdraw.

The buttons are placed in separate blocks to make the layout clear and easy to style.

2. CSS Styling
The body is styled to create a full viewport height layout that centers the content both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox (display: flex, justify-content: center, align-items: center).

The background color of the page is a subtle light gray (#e0e0e0) for a clean and modern look.

The .outer_box uses a semi-transparent light gray background (#adaaaaf6), padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow to separate it visually from the background.

The .inner_box has a white background with padding, rounded corners, and a soft shadow, making it stand out inside the outer box.

The <h1> displays the balance in large, dark text centered within the box.

Buttons are styled with padding, margin, no borders, rounded corners, and a pointer cursor to indicate interactivity.

The .deposit button uses a green background (#28a745) and white text to symbolize adding money.

The .withdraw button uses a red background (#dc3545) and white text to represent removing money.
